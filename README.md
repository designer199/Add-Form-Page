## Dated : 2st Nov 2018

- [x] Add form page is completed and responsive for mobile ,tablet and desktop.

## Things that I noticed

 - [ ] The original sass code threw a lot of errors when compiled into css and the page was not responsive. So I had to  write    new code in bootstrap 4 to make the form mobile-first/responsive.
